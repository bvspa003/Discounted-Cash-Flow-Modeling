Fight on.
Welcome back in the previous task, we have forecasted
all financials to five years.
This task we're going to calculate our terminal value
and the exit multiples.
So what is this Terminal Valley, Actually?
Well, because we cannot forecast our cash flows forever, we
still have to full cast.
Uh, how much will the business be worth at the end?
So we do that basically, by our and two brass valley
to Abbott.
A multiple approach.
So what this means ISS How much?
How many years off the earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization would need to get a full return
on our company subjectively for German blue chip companies.
Uh, and BMW is a German blue chip company.
We would ideally have even to ebita multiple off 20 on.
This is highly subjective.
On dhe when you want to have on every two ebita multiple, you
just google the TV to EBITA multiple for the relative size
of for the relevant size of the company and for its interest
rate. So we use every two ebita multiple
of 20 for this assumption on dhe.
Now, in order to promote to get this value, how we do that
is is we take our rabbit, take our epic dem on Dhe Not
in order to get EBITA, which we have here Abbot.
Now we should add back the depreciation and amortization.
So let's take it for the last year and at BEC appreciation
and amortization.
Then we multiply by our multiple on disease.
All we get the terminal value and then we just go to our X
value on just make or for here.
So that will be our exit, Valya, that will use in our
in discounting our cash flows.
Great. So in this task with calculated our terminal value,
that will need to know evaluation in the next OSK
we are going, Teoh actually calculate our free cash flows
to the company in order to, uh, get everything done
for the final valuations.
Thank you.
On. I'll see you in the next task.
